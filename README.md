# breast_cancer_ml_project

Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women worldwide. It accounts for 25.4% of all cancer cases and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2018 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The Month of March celebrates International Women's Day. Therefore, we have decided to work on a project that can help save the lives of women in the world. 

It is a note of facts that the critical challenge against breast cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous). Early detection leads to prevention. 

Therefore, we have decided that we would be using Machine Learning to classify these tumors into Benign(Non-cancerous) and Malignant(Cancerous) using three different models.
This will help predict if a tumor is Benign or Malignant.  

We shall be using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
